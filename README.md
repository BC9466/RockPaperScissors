# UBC
There are two Python projects in this:

1) Rock Paper Scissors
This python project has a GUI with Tkinter and has options to pick an opponent from various skill levels depicted as (Average Joe, Monkey, and Brain).
Average Joe will be considered as medium difficulty while Monkey will always have a draw with you. Although Brain is more likely to win based on increased chance of choosing the winning choice between rock, paper, scissors.

2) Weather App
This python project is what I learnt off YouTube to retrieve information with an API, with additional information retrieved that were not in the video.
This project is also GUI based. The youtube video link is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JoMTQgdxg0&ab_channel=teachmesome
