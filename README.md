# Rock Paper Scissors with bots!

 Rock Paper Scissors

This course python project has a GUI with Tkinter and has options to pick an opponent from various skill levels depicted as (Average Joe, Monkey, and Brain).
Average Joe will be considered as medium difficulty while Monkey will always have a draw with you. Although Brain is more likely to win based on increased chance of choosing the winning choice between rock, paper, scissors. This collaboration project was done by myself (Dennis Phan) and my partner, Cheng-Hsi Li.
